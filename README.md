# FLARE - Finite eLement Analysis foR Electromagnetics
## Quick Start
The `run_FLARE.m` file contains a few examples involving the different solvers in FLARE
### Generating mesh files
Once `gmsh` in installed in your system, run one of the .geo files in the `mesh` directory. A `.m` file will be generated, that can be loaded in FLARE to be used as a mesh for the given case
